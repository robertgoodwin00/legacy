<h4>Kachoufuugetsu</h4>

This is my best attempt to translate the fold-up Special Interview liner 

that comes with the album Kachoufuugetsu.  Thanks to Oga for help explaining some of the terms.<br>

Kachoufuugetsu (meaning 'flower-bird-wind-moon') is a collection

of B-sides and other songs by Spitz throughout the years that were not

available on regular albums.  In this interview the four members of the

band talk freely about each of these songs and the memories associated

with them...  

<p>

Kusano (K): You know, I've wanted since before to put out this kind of thing.

<br>Miwa (M): They're pretty much all here, huh. 

<br>Tamura (T): There are the pathetic songs that although they were recorded as candidates 

for singles, ended up becoming B-sides and in the end were not included on albums.

This is an album that shines the light of day on those kind of songs. (laugh)  

<br>Sakiyama (S): There are some that we recorded only and never performed live.

<br>K: They are the songs of the 'uncrowned emperor' that weren't used for that role. (laugh)

The criterion for selection was that they weren't included on an ablum.  Well,

there's also the pattern in which the single version was not included on the album,

like 'Scarlet', but if we did that we'd have to include a mountain's worth so scratch that.

  Songs that were B-sides are the core.

<p>

<i>Nagareboshi</i>

<br>K: We did this one live back in our amateur days.  Even though it had become a

candidate for recording to about the time of our second album, it is a song that got

looked off.  At first it had a reggae style of arrangement.  At that time there were quite

a few bands, such as "La-ppisch" and "The Boom", that incorporated reggae and ska rhythms and I tried doing

the same, but now when I listen to that version I get the feeling that my attempt was sort

of childish.  

<br>T: The balance between tune and arrangement wasn't there, you know.

<br>K: We omitted it this time, but Tetsuya's chorus had been included in it.

<br>S: Well he was sounding it in his head.

<br>T: Henmi Emiri sang it for us.

<br>K: The lyrics were lyrics of the time of 'Umbeboshi' and 'Hibari no Kokoro';  songs that I 

wouldn't write now.  But there are many memories.  The time of 'Chicken George' and such.

<br>S: Before doing that song a guitar string snapped.

<br>K: Our roadie wasn't there yet so we had to change strings ourselves.  At Kobe's 'Chicken George' from long

ago, the stage and music room separated by a great distance.  Moreover, since everyone was assembled it took time,

and when I returned, the guests were all looking blank.  Back then our members didn't do any MC-ing at all. (laugh)  

I remember after that wiping cold sweat while performing.  

<br>M: We tried chatting two or three times but didn't continue it.

<br>K: We could do it now!

<br>M: I wonder.  Tricks maybe I could do.  (laugh)

<br>K: This time around we've borrowed the wisdom of Shirai Ryomei as a co-producer.

<p>

<i>Ai no Shirushi</i>

<br>K: This one like 'Nagareboshi' is also a new recording with Shirai Ryomei as a producer.

It's the first song that I wrote out for someone else.  It was to be a candidate for 'Fake Fur' on the

demo tape I made, but, you know...  At the same time I had a talk from Tamio to "Write a song for Puffy"

and it went that way.  The lyrics were written completely with Puffy in mind.  I think the lyrics wouldn't

have become like they did if I was going to sing it.  That it became a hit is probably due to the power of Puffy.

<br>T: I didn't know it would become a single!

<br>S: It wasn't scheduled to but it became a single anyway.

<br>K: At that time the recording industry critics wrote "written in the character of Puffy" but I was thinking they didn't 

even know what was up.  (laugh) That melody was mine!  

<br>T: The arrangement also has a nice feeling to it.  It was in Kusano's demo tape but it was one of the ones Tamio

arranged, and hearing Puffy, we were again influenced back by it.     

<br>K: I guess it has the kind of feeling of Nakajima Miyuki saying "Welcome home".

<br>M: It's the biggest hit of the songs Masamune wrote last year. (laugh)

<p>

<i>Supika</i>

<br>K: This is the first song we recorded for 'Fake Fur'.  We were talking of having either

'Unmei no Hito' or this song become singles in advance, but in the end it got warehoused.  

Not because the song wasn't good, but because it didn't seem to fit the atmosphere (fur color ^^) of the album.  

After that there was a tie-up with JAL's rizoccha (Japan Air Lines' advertising slogan; the song was played in one of their commercials) and it got to see the light of day.

<br>M: I think we were still following the method of 'Indigo Chiheisen' when we started recording this.

But, there being something different, gradually the way of doing 'Fake Fur' became visible.  To put it simply,

Masamune doesn't play the guitar on this song, but he plays on most of the songs that were included

on 'Fake Fur'.  

<br>S: After this it became so that the all of us do the recording in one shot.

<br>K: It's a song that gave us various new starts (to do something new).

<br>M: By "putting it on the album, it would get in one's head", there was that kind of thing, too.

<br>T: The alternate title was 'like flour'.  (laugh)

<p>

<i>Tabibito</i>

<br>K: Why I wonder?  My memories of this song are few.  There's all sorts of memories of the other songs. (laugh)

<br>S: It's the first song we recorded in session for 'Indigo Chiheisen'.

<br>M: Kelly-chan is on the cover.

<br>K: When we were making the demo tape for this song, Tetsuya didn't come to the meeting no

matter how long we waited.

<br>M: Oh, that time.  (laugh)

<br>K: He wouldn't pick up the phone when we called, and when we all went to his house

he was sleeping. (laugh)

<br>M: The room with the phone was far away.  When I went to the door my boss down to everyone from

the office were there.  No, excuse me. (laugh) 

<br>T: But it was accepted well when we played it live, even though it was a new song.

<br>S: When we said it was a new song, everyone anticipated us to play 'Nagisa' and with

an 'Eeee?' were disappointed.  After we started playing it they accepted it though.

<br>K: To me personally it has with it the impression that I was able to make a Pop song.  

<p>

<i>Ore no Subete</i>

<br>K: It's the B-side of 'Robinson'.  When I completed it I thought it was better (than 'Robinson'), and 

on the first day of recording and rehearsal I wondered if we hadn't fit 'Ore no Subete' well.  

<br>M: Everyone got excited when they heard the title.  Because up to that time, the word 'Ore' (low form for 'me') 

hadn't been used.

<br>S: It had an impact.

<br>M: But, looking at it another way, I didn't like it.  

<br>T: And so the 'not-positive' 'Robinson' was chosen. (laugh)

<br>K: When I made 'Robinson' I thought it was too pop-py and wondered if it would make for a single.  Something 

about it wasn't positive!  But unnaturally and suddenly I thought 'Ore no Subete' had become manly.  

<br>T: If this had been the main song I wonder what would have happened.

<br>K: Maybe there'd have been a completely different Spitz history.  It might be interesting to think

about that while you listen to this song.

<p>

<i>Neko ni Naritai</i>

<br>K: It's a B-side of 'Aoi Kuruma' but this one too from process of beginning to end was the main.  Because I was thinking

of the single jacket with that intention it has the motif of a cat ornament.

<br>T: 'Aoi Kuruma' had more of a tempo and a feel, and with us at that time looking to express our feeling 

I think we preferred that to be heard.  

<br>K: When we performed at Power Station before it's release, 'Aoi Kuruma' was received well and, as a new song,

this only didn't have a good reception so we went with that ('Aoi Kuruma').  But now when I think about it,

even if 'Neko ni Naritai' was the main, I get the feeling we would have been widely accepted.  In fan club popularity polls

it gets high ratings and such.  Among people who have supported Spitz for a long time there seem to be many people

who like this song.

<br>S: The jacket just as it is is peculiar, isn't it? (laugh)

<br>K: But why a cat?  Maybe I felt that when I was busy, once in awhile it would be nice

to sleep all day long like a cat. (laugh)

<p>

<i>Kokoro no Soko Kara</i>

<br>M: Don't you think this is the most pathetic song among here? (laugh)

<br>K: Although we only performed it live once, the guests' response was not so good so 

we left it at that.  This along with 'Hadaka no Mama de' and 'Kimi ga Omoide ni Naru mae ni'

we did for the first time together with Sasaji, the producer of 'Crispy!' and 'Indigo Chiheisen'.

We wanted to have him make an arrangement and so the feeling that it has been

arranged by someone is strong I guess.  I think that if we did it now the intro with the whistling

would be done with guitar.

<br>M: Weren't we poor at performing songs arranged (by someone else) live back then?

<br>T: Listening to it now we don't feel that way, but back at that time we were awfully embarrassed

about lyrics like "Kokoro no soko kara aishiteru". ("I love you from the depths of my heart") (laugh)

<br>K: The way I came up with this tune was when I was walking down Kichijoji and I thought at 

that time that this song would be our big break.  I thought it would be invincible.  Don't ask me why. (laugh)

Like 'kimi ga omoide ni naru mae ni', the words 'kokoro no soko kara' to me at that time were 'sure sell' words! (laugh)

<br>T: It's the least famous song on this album. (laugh)

<p>

<i>Maameido</i>

<br>M: When I listen to this I am reminded of Ookubo's curry udon. (laugh)

<br>K: It was at a studio called "Freedom Studio".  The grandma there made curry udon and hot

dogs for us.  

<br>S: There was regular udon also (noodles).

<br>T: I remember after playing a (video) game, the boss from the office got mad at me saying

"You do nothing but play games." (laugh)

<br>K: We recorded this at the time of 'Hoshi no Kakera' and we were unsure whether to include 'Naminori'

or this song on the album, though in the end we chose 'Naminori' and this song became a B-side.

However, we didn't play 'Naminori' live so much and conversely 'Maameido' became an important part

of our repertoire.  

<br>T: We had a lot of fun with this one live I suppose.

<br>K: In the letters of those who watched us live and stuff like that we got asked quite a bit 

"Which album is 'Maameido' on?".  I guess because 'Hoshi no Kakera' was an album that said "We aren't going to be meek"

we may have been thinking that the meekness of this song didn't fit it.

<p>

<i>Kosumosu</i>

<br>K: This is also on par with 'Kokoro no Soko Kara' in being a song that wasn't a winner.

<br>T: As for the tune, it is a long one like the kind of 'Oorora ni Narenakatta Hito no Tame ni'. 

Close to tunes like 'Naifu', I guess.

<br>K: It's got a dreamy feeling to it.  The alternate title was 'Belmondo', you know.  

There was a movie I was watching on channel 12 that had Jean-Paul Belmondo in it, a movie in

which a pure man dies accordingly of his own pureness.  It was a sad movie.  This song was inspired

by it. 

<br>M: Recording was a pain.  The studio was in the basement and all that.

<br>T: Because if we were to do it now we would try and do all the parts where the keyboard plays 

on guitar instead.

<br>K: I just remembered something silly.  At that time I had written and posted up the lyrics 

and our engineer, Bokuya, asked "What do you mean by 'mochitsu'?" at the place where I

had written 'motif'.  (laugh)  It's because my lyrics were handwritten back then.

<br>M: He was probably hungry.  Because we were in the studio 15 hours it was tough to find

time to eat. (laugh)  Also, I reckon Masamune around that time was rather worried about lyrics.  

<br>K: It was period of time in which my words wouldn't conform to my images.  It was a time that

despite images coming to my head rapidly, I would be at a loss when I put them to words and they

werent' the same.  This is a song that displays that situation our band was in.    

<p>

<i>Yasei no Chuurippu</i>

<br>K: We started playing this one with 'Nagareboshi' in our amateur days.  It was recorded for our second 

album but because it was kind of different, I suppose, we warehoused it.  Like the deal with Henmi, 

this was sung by Yusa Mimori.  Does it have the feeling of that original?

<br>T: The lyrics are different, but...

<br>K: Of course a woman would sing the part with 'sakari', huh.  This time around, for inclusion in this album

Bokuya (the engineer of 'Hoshi no Kakera' and '99ep's 'Sakana'), who has helped us since the Indies era

remixed it for us.  

<br>T: Because, you know, the Spitz version of this song hadn't come out in the world yet. 

After we announced so before, there was a weird talk about remix-ing it.  We were interested in

how a performance from eight years ago would be if mixed with our sensation of today so we

remixed it.    

<p>

<i>Tori ni Natte</i>

<br>K: The fact is, this is the very first song for which we made a sound sheet by ourselves and put up to the recording

company for sale.  At places like the Shinjuku edition and Ikebukuro's Fifth Avenue. 

<br>T: Or like Kobe's Indies Shop.  

<br>K: We made it and sold it.  It's a song that has those memories.  Completed on the first year of 

the formation of our band, this was along with 'Hibari no Kokoro' the representative song of our band

in its amateur days.

<br>T: It's the oldest song among these.  

<br>K: In our amateur days we pushed those keywords.  We had the "Tori ni Natchau Hi" ("Day to turn into a bird")

event at Shinjuku Loft ten or so times.  

<br>S: We were sure to play this song every time we played live, I think.  

<br>T: I wonder why it wasn't put on our first album?

<br>M: Was it not taken off our sound sheet?

<br>S: The words "tsurete tte morau" ("say that you will take me along") have commonality to 'Aoi Kuruma'.

<br>T: It contains the foundation; the essence of our band. (laugh)

<br>S: We recorded this from the beginnning with the intention of putting it on a single as a B-side, you know.

We wanted to do it just right once.  

<br>K: That was so, huh.  But it wasn't on anything except the sound sheet.  There was that practice of not

putting songs that were B-sides on regular albums then, huh.   

<p>

<i>Oppai</i>

<br>K: There was a six-song-long mini-album with Indies, and, the same is true for 'Togetoge no Ki', but 

there were a lot of people who wanted to hear 'Oppai'.  That CD strangely got really expensive at 

used CD places so we are trying to meet that demand.

<br>T: But even hearing the word 'Oppai' it wasn't weird at all.  It wasn't a turn-off.

<br>M: More than the word 'Oppai', the melody was good, and therefore it entered in (into the song) naturally probably.

<br>K: I think we were shy one or two years after our debut, but we aren't anymore at all.  It was

ten years ago and we had that feeling of being observed.  

<br>T: We weren't aiming for it.  In those days there was a band boom and there were a lot of bands

that were aiming for certain tunes and lyrics.  If it had been that kind of a song it would have been known

in a different light, but it wasn't.

<br>K: Just completely saying 'Oppai' conversely makes it become not H.  A roundabout way of

saying it makes it H.  On the contrary, when I listen to it now it sounds health-oriented.  

<br>T: Our goal was to play live at the loft and to put out the Indies record and we got what we

wanted, but anyhow it didn't sell so well, did it.  (laugh)

<br>K: There were copies left over from two thousand made.  It's because 'junsuka' sold so well.  How sad.  (laugh)

<br>M: You know, I went to a CD shop to see if it was out in the front. 

<br>T: It was sad to see it at a recycle shop in Fuchuu.

<br>K: Hey, it wasn't on 'Spitz' but on 'Hibari no Kokoro'.  (laugh)   

<p>

<i>Togetoge no Ki</i>

<br>K: It's a new song that I wrote for the Indies CD 'Hibari no Kokoro'.

At that time I had confidence in what I had written, but they called it 'dodonpa rock' (old style Japanese jazz funk).

<br>T: It was the first performance of a song as a premise for recording.  We recorded other

songs performed live but this was different.

<br>S: We lodged together then; that was salty water I can't forget.

<br>K: The compulsuroy overnighter.      

<br>M: We were at wit's end then.  Despite all of us being drinkers, I think we fell

asleep without any desire to get drunk.

<br>S: Tetsuya had said "I'm going to think a little and come back" and left

the studio without coming back. (laugh)

<br>K: By the term 'hanamuguri' in the lyrics I meant the bug that crawls into roses and eats them.

When I am bothered by something I'd think "Hanamuguri ni naritee na" ("I want to become that bug"). (laugh)

I hadn't realized it but people around who heard this song would say "It sounds like poetry of our time"

and would quickly start reading poetry around them.  Having been told that I read also.  (laugh)  I wrote it

in an inoffensive manner peculiar to myself but, you know...  Since it is different from the poetry of our

world today, depending on the person there may be some who prefer that time's (poetry).

<p>

<i>Ka-chou-fuu-getsu</i>

<br>K: At first we were thinking of calling the title 'Spitz/The back roads'.  But that would have pitiable for

the songs.  From around '99ep' it was to be 'Wafuu Mode' (Japan-style mode).  We were thinking of calling it

'Fuugetsu' but there's that candy shop.  (laugh)  Anyways the words 'flower' 'bird' 'wind' and 'moon' appear in

our lyrics and because we use those words a lot we figured it would be easy to remember.  

<br>S: The significance is deep!

<br>M: I would suppose that it has some meaning since it is a current release.  

After putting out the self-produced '99ep' we recorded two songs anew to put on this album, and 

I get the feeling that what we had to do next became clear.  You know, I think it will connect

to the next original album.  

<br>T: When you listen to the songs of our early days it will cause you to realize what we have lost and those sensations.

Naturally we've gained new things too.  I understood how I liked our new and our old songs and was able to confirm

the things we had to overcome.  Our band's rival was our old self!

<br>K: There were times when I thought too hard.  There are also places that make me feel at ease when I listen to our old songs.

<br>S: I suppose it puts back to back the pleasant parts and the parts that make us want to cover our heads with shame.

<br>M: I think it is an album with much meaning.  Speaking of singles, because they are often released prior to the album,

the recording of them becomes the album's first session.  Since there are so many songs included here that were B-sides, it is often the case that

each album's beginning sprang from there.  

<br>K: We are a band that bundles together all sorts of things.  I'd like people to think we are an interesting band.

I think that with this album people would perhaps feel even more that we are a 'from here on out' kind of band.  It is sad if

there are people who consider this our best album.  (laugh)  Well, I guess it would be better than being told that our 'Best Album' is 

the best one.  (laugh)
