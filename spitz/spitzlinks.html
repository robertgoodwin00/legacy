There aren't a great number of English Spitz-related web pages out there, but here's some of the prominent ones.  I also include a few of the many Japanese pages devoted to Spitz for those who can read Japanese.
<!--If you know how to read Japanese but do not know how to display Japanese characters,
see this help page for <a href="../view_japanese.html">viewing Japanese characters</a>.
(If you can't read Japanese, well, hey, that's what I made this site for!)-->
