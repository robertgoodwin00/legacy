<!-- <p><br>07-05-04 Just for fun...
<br>So I recently bought this cheesy old synthesizer.  It sure is a bundle of joy for what I paid for it. ^=^ Here's an example of the sort of fun you can have with an instrument like this when you've got as much free time as I've got: <a href="robg - crispy (spitz).mpg">Crispy</a> (mp3)
<br>I used a microphone to make the recording because the thing has no outputs.  Heh, it's so old that it predates all that.  -->

<h3>Introduction to Spitz</h3>
Spitz is a rock band that has earned itself a reputation and a solid fan following in Japan for music with catchy rhythms, beautiful vocals, and a nostalgic sort of atmosphere. What I like best about the music of Spitz are its great melodies, crafted by gifted songwriter Kusano Masamune.  They are simply unbeatable.  I also appreciate Spitz for being the most consistent band I've ever come across.  After over ten years of making music their style has not changed significantly (I mean this in a good way) and IMO if there's any album by this band worth hearing, it's all of them!
<p>
I became acquainted with the music of Spitz while riding in a friend's car in Japan.  Although I was already familiar with many mainstream Japanese artists of the day, I had no idea a band called Spitz existed.
After hearing for the first time songs such as <i>Aoi Kuruma</i> and <i>Nagisa</i> I was instantly hooked. They are still one of my very favorite artists today.
