<h4>A-ha and Spitz</h4>
A-ha is a Scandinavian band that became famous in the 80's with the song
"Take on Me" and continued to put out quality music for many years.
I find that A-ha and Spitz music are similar in terms of style, atmosphere, vocals, and so on.
Especially songs like Spitz's "Amai Te".  That could easily be an A-ha song.
Both bands seem to also maintain a high level of dignity.  Or in other words, the members of both
bands are people that I think I could respect, not 'sell-outs'.  Most importantly,
the song-writing of both bands is brilliant.  In short, if you are a Spitz fan and 
haven't heard A-ha, I would recommend A-ha to you.  If you are an A-ha fan and haven't heard
Spitz, I would recommend Spitz to you.

<h4>I just love my Fake Fur</h4>
Even before I had heard all of the tracks on it, I knew it was going to become my
favorite Spitz album.  From beginning to end that album is nothing but terrific songs.
There is the upbeat and carefree "Unmei no Hito", the introspective "Tsumetai Hoho",
"She-she!!", a song which sounds to everyone like the Beatles' "Let it Be" the first time they hear it,
"Supernova", a song that begs to be played on your stereo loud, "Kaede", a sad yet beautiful 'break-up' song
that cannot be disliked, and... I could go on.  They're all fabulous!  I positively dig this album.
  It's Spitz at their best.

<h4>Why isn't Spitz recognized in the West?</h4>
We pretty much already know why, don't we?  It's because Westerners are narrow-minded.
We (speaking on behalf of the West, particularly America) are hesitant, perhaps a little afraid,
 to consider the culture and achievements of countries that don't speak English.  On one level
there seems to be a fear that what we will find in other cultures, especially Asian ones, is
better than what we have got in our own culture.  I think it goes back to when Japan was producing better
cars than we were and nobody could figure out why, hehe.  You can find this phenomenon in other areas, but in
the area of music it is especially blatant to me.  See the Tomobiki J-pop Guide at 
<a href="http://www.tomobiki.com/wagaku/intro.htm" target="_top">http://www.tomobiki.com/wagaku/intro.htm</a>
for further discussion on this.  
<br>Moreover, Spitz is even more 'Nihon-teki' than other Japanese popular music.  Consequently, 
they are even less well-known.  I don't think I would change that either.  Spitz fans like Spitz just how they are
and I am no exception.
If Spitz music were to be adapted to English, that wouldn't seem right to me.  It would be much better if
Westerners would simply recognize them for the superb Japanese band that they are.  
Which will likely never happen.  But I'm trying as best as I can:)

<h4>Astronomical references</h4>
Astronomical references seem to be a recurrent theme in the lyrics of Spitz music.
Here's a list of songs that have a word or phrase associated with the sky
or the cosmos.  And there's still many Spitz songs I haven't yet heard, so there are
prob'ly lots more.
