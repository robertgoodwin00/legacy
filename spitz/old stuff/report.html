<h1><center>Mizuiro no Machi MTV</center></h1>
<p>
This movie starts off with a shot of a flowing stream, a shot directly at the water, sort of discrbing the emotions of the song following. The flowing stream fades out into a new pan from the camera at a vertical shot of Kusano-san in a white suit with black pants with the water shot behind him. The movie then turns away, facing Kusano-san directly, about 20 ft away, with a lush forest on a cliff, with that same stream-river behind him, (Kusano-san is not singing in the video, yet). The camera pans to an ore in the stream, creating white water flowing swiftly away. 
<p>
A small black period, to then have a shot of a lake with tiny cliffs barely noticable in the horizon with a white boat in the center of the lake (possibly Kusano-san inside, sitting). Now the movie is starting to move (as in, not have still pictures), with an elephant (waving tail) on the beach (same lake) underneath a torii arch next to a bridge in the distance. Kusano then looks across the screen (sitting). The lake shows up again, but the camera rising up the the cloudy sky. Please keep in mind, the whole video is in a bluish-grey color, therefore, has a rainy feeling. 
<p>
A very emotional part comes up, the elephant follows Kusano-san on the beach, as if they were pursuing something. Kusano-san then looks up to the cloudy sky, in a dizzy-spiral motion. The elephant and Kusano-san are standing infront of a Japanese-type house, but has a big sign on top, with Thai. This means that this video was not shot in Japan, but overseas in Thailand. Another emotional part comes up, Kusano-san stands looking at the elephant, then walks away, while the big elephant watchs him leave, as if they have accomplished something, very powerful! The climax of the song shows Tetsuya-san playing with the guitar, with the water mixed in to the backround (two shots put together). 
<p>
After the climax, the movie just repeats some seens from before like looking at the elephant, face to face, and the ore in the water. The movie ends with Kusano-san finally singing the powerful tune (the whole band in backround) with a black backround behind them. As the last bit of the song goes on, the fade off, as if they were flowing with that stream before at the begin of the video. 
<p>
Overall, I love this video, I really gets to you with the sad, yet ballad tune and the grey colors, leaving the elephant behind, as if Kusano-san was leaving this world, for example; death. When you say your last words to someone... this is a VERY powerfull MTV, that is even more symbolic. Spitz videos usually have a reason to be made, well, some, especially this one, Mizuiro no machi.
