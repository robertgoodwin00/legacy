If you haven't heard Spitz yet, here is a chance to sample
a few of their songs.  These get changed every few months or so without notice.  My bandwidth on Tripod is limited, so you may have to try again later depending on traffic.

<!--<p><a href="spitz-scarlet.mp3">Scarlet</a> -- One of their better known songs.  It's the sort of melancholy, yet memorable tune that Spitz is so good at.  The single version is only slightly different than the one on the album "Fake Fur".
<br><a href="spitz-orenosubete.mp3">Ore no Subete</a> -- A cheerful song with a steady, driving rhythm.  I like the guitar solo that fades out at the end.  
This was originally a B-side on the "Robinson" single, but can now be found on the album "Kachofugetsu". 
<br><a href="spitz-gerbera.mp3">Gerbera</a> -- A slow moody melody that conveys a feeling of isolation.  It is available on the "Sawatte Kawatte" single and on the album "Mikazuki Rock". -->

<!--<p><a href="spitz-nagisa.mp3">Nagisa</a> -- 
Meaning "the beach".  One of the first Spitz songs I ever heard.  It made a fan out of me,
and remains one of my favorites to date.  From the album <i>Indigo Chiheisen</i>, and available as a single.
<br><a href="spitz-bidama.mp3">Biidama</a> -- 
Meaning "marbles".  A melody that makes you feel like you're going around and around in circles.  The harmonica suits it.  
From their first album <i>Spitz</i>.  Also available on the <i>Hibari no Kokoro</i> single. 
<br><a href="spitz-tsumetai.mp3">Tsumetai Hoho</a> -- 
Meaning "your cold cheek".  I'm quite fond of this song, although I didn't think much of it at first.
Now I can listen to it time and time again.  From the album <i>Fake Fur</i> and available as a single.-->

<!-- Haven't uploaded yet <p><a href="spitz-unmei no hito.mp3">Unmei no Hito (album version)</a> --
Meaning "person of destiny".  With an upbeat rhythm and a positive tone, this song ranks as one of my very favorites.  From the album <i>Fake Fur</i>, and available as a single. -->

<!--<p><a href="spitz-mikanz.mp3">Mikanz no Teema</a> --
"Theme of Mikanz".  Don't ask me what it means, just enjoy it.  :)  From the newest album <i>Mikazuki Rock</i>.
<br><a href="spitz-spider.mp3">Spider</a> -- 
A catchy tune that can immediately be enjoyed after one hearing.  From the album <i>Sora no Tobikata</i>, and available as a single.
<br><a href="spitz-namida.mp3">Namida</a> --
Meaning "tears".  A beautiful melody accompanied not by electric guitars and drums, but by classical strings; the sort of thing I wish Spitz would try more often!  This song is not typical of Spitz, but I put it up anyway, perhaps to encourage folks to check out the underrated mini-album <i>Aurora ni Narenakatta Hito no Tame ni</i> that it appears on. -->

<!--<p><a href="spitz-unmei.mp3">Unmei no Hito</a> -- Meaning "Person of destiny", a cheerful and upbeat song that has proven to be one of my long-time favorites.  From the album <i>Fake Fur</i> and avalailable on single.  
<br><a href="spitz-spica.mp3">Supika</a> -- "Spica", another cheerful and upbeat tune.  It was played on a JAL commercial some time ago I think.  From the album <i>Kachofugetsu</i> and coupled on the <i>Kaede</i> single.
<br><a href="spitz-y.mp3">Y</a> -- This one is neither cheerful nor upbeat.  Fans of Spitz have speculated that the title refers to a fork in the road.  Whatever the meaning, it's a song possessing a gentle endearing melody.  From the album <i>Hachimitsu</i>. -->

<!--<p><a href="spitz-miiko.mp3">Miiko to Gitaa</a> -- In their own style, a song as fun and good-natured as any Spitz has done.  From the album <i>Namae wo Tsuketeyaru</i>.
<br><a href="spitz-scarlet.mp3">Scarlet</a> -- Scarlet really illustrates Kusano's ability to write simple, perfect melodies that remain with the listener long afterwards.  It is also one of Spitz' most famous songs.  From the album <i>Fake Fur</i> and as a single.
<br><a href="spitz-kimi.mp3">Kimi ga Omoide ni Naru mae ni</a> -- Another of Spitz' most famous and beloved songs, having a theme of the traditional sad "breakup" variety.  From the album <i>Crispy</i> and as a single.-->


<!-- <p><a href="spitz-akane.mp3">Akane</a> -- The kind of song that's good to close an album with.  (<i>Hayabusa</i>)
<br><a href="spitz-hibari.mp3">Hibari no Kokoro</a> -- From their first album <i>Spitz</i>.  This is one of the numbers Spitz started their career off with.  
<br><a href="spitz-sora.mp3">Sora mo Toberu Hazu</a> -- A vintage Spitz song.  Should be familiar to many.  From the album <i>Sora no Tobikata</i> and available on single. -->

<!--
<p><a href="spitz-escargot.mp3">Escargot</a> -- It'll make you get up and dance.  (album <i>Mikaduki Rock</i>)
<br><a href="spitz-robinson.mp3">Robinson</a> -- Traditionally this is my favorite song by Spitz.  The melody is unbeatable. (album <i>Hachimitsu</i> and available as single)-->

<br><a href="spitz-tori_ni_natte.mp3">Tori ni Natte</a>

<br><a href="spitz-mune.mp3">Mune ni saita kiiroi hana</a>
<br><a href="spitz-lunaluna.mp3">Lunaluna</a>-->

<p><a href="spitz-hourou_kamome.mp3">Hourou Kamome ha Doko made mo</a> - Catchy tune :-)  From the album <i>Hayabusa</i>.
<br><a href="spitz-dolphin_love.mp3">Dolphin Love</a> - Spitz should make more songs like this!  From the album <i>Crispy!</i>.
